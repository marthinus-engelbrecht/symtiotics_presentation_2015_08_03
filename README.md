To run this demo you need: 
 
1.  Node installed on your pc
2.  A static http server. I would recommend `live-sever`. Just run the below in your commandline: 

  ```
    npm install -g live-server 
  ```
  
    Then execute the `live-server` command in the client_side app directory.
3.  Execute the `node express-server` command in the server_side directory to start up the node sever. git 

P.S: The actual power point presentation can be found in the root directory of this demo.
